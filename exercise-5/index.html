            We’ve gathered ten different lessons these professional artists wish they knew at the start of their own art careers. <br><br>

            <figcaption> <em>An outgoing introvert, a seeker of quiet spaces in a busy world, and a self-taught painter, <span>Maryanne Hawes</span> '  bold paintings appeal to those who seek meaning amongst the ordinary. She now paints full-time and lives and works between the lower Wye Valley and her family’s homeland, Cornwall, England.</em></figcaption>

            <h3>Trust your creative vision as an artist</h3>
            <p >Your art career will ebb and flow—there might be days when you struggle to find the inspiration to step into your studio. That's perfectly okay! Trust that the creative spark will reignite.  <br><br>
  
              Not everyone will understand what you're trying to express through your art, but the most important audience for your work is you. Embrace your instincts and your unique voice will shine through.

                <p><i>"Trust yourself. If you can’t get into the studio today, then you will tomorrow. If you made horrible work today, then soon this will lead to something beautiful. <br><br>

                  You don’t need to listen to all the voices—the ones in your head or the people that don’t get what you’re trying to do—just trust yourself. <br><br>
                  
                  Your art has a valuable place in the world. You just need to keep on making it."
